# Voice Transfer Across Languages

### Task list
*In no particular order:*
- [ ] Reformulate the subject and a short description of how the implementation will work
- [ ] Finish the analysis of 1806.04558
- [ ] Find out which other papers to analyse first
- [ ] Reformat my paper/dataset notes in markdown (?)
- [ ] Get started on the SOTA review
- [ ] Get started on the description of 1806.04558 
- [ ] Get started on the analysis of the benchmarks in 1806.04558 

### Roadmap
**For the 19th of October**:
- Review the current SOTA  (weaknesses/strengths w.r.t. [1806.04558](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04558.pdf))
- Complete description of the architecture of 1806.04558 (embedded models, exotic layers)
- Analysis of the benchmarks (data used, metrics)

**For later**:
- Implement 1806.04558 as a baseline
- Evaluate the quality of this baseline w.r.t. the reported results in 1806.04558

**For much later**:
- Adapt/Improve the cross-language aspect baseline

### Other things
- Settle on the title of the thesis (prefix with deep/neural?, 
- Migrate repo to github once the baseline is decent *(possibly, make it an open source repo on its own and keep working on transfer across languages as a fork)*
