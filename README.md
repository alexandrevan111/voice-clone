### Task list
*In no particular order:*
- [x] Reformulate the subject and a short description of how the implementation will work
- [x] Finish the analysis of SV2TTS
- Other papers to read:
  - [x] Tacotron 2
  - [ ] Tacotron 1
- [ ] Reformat my paper/dataset notes in markdown (?)
- [ ] Get started on the SOTA review
- [ ] Get started on the description of SV2TTS 
- [ ] Get started on the analysis of the benchmarks in SV2TTS 

### Roadmap
**For the 19th of October**:
- Review the current SOTA  (weaknesses/strengths w.r.t. SV2TTS)
- Complete description of the architecture of SV2TTS (embedded models, exotic layers)
- Analysis of the benchmarks (data used, metrics)

**For later**:
- Implement SV2TTS as a baseline
- Evaluate the quality of this baseline w.r.t. the reported results in SV2TTS

**For much later**:
- Adapt/Improve the cross-language aspect baseline

### Other things
- Setup Matheo (must be done between the 1st and 30th of November)
- Settle on the title of the thesis (prefix with deep/neural?, add something to indicate the intended application?)
- Migrate repo to github once the baseline is decent *(possibly, make it an open source repo on its own and keep working on transfer across languages as a fork)*
