### Task list (for writing)
- [ ] Rewrite the SOTA to be more focused
- [ ] Present SV2TTS
- For the encoder:
  - [ ] Present the implementation and that of the authors
  - [ ] Present the results
- For the Tacotron 2 implementation:
  - [ ] Describe the architecture
  - [ ] Present the modifications I've made
- [ ] Make speed tests for every part of the framework
	
### Milestones
**For the end of March**
- Write about 8 new pages
- Gather the different parts of the framework in a single demonstration tool
- Settle on the vocoder and provide an implementation

**For later**:
- Explore the approaches I've proposed for a deeper analysis of the framework

### Other things
- Migrate repo to github once the baseline is decent
