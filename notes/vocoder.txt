How about a nonlinear encoding? https://i.imgur.com/xRWn6AE.png
-> talk about linear encoding and mulaw


NOTES:
- tacotron_model.ckpt-486000 was the model used to generate GTA.
- best lost on mu_law: 2.935

TODO:
- Meanwhile, work on a rough inference demo (don't forget to show side-by-side generated and original sample)
- Pruning
- Begin merging the three projects
- Clean up the rest of the code
- Batch inputs?
