How about a nonlinear encoding? https://i.imgur.com/xRWn6AE.png
-> talk about linear encoding and mulaw


NOTES:
- tacotron_model.ckpt-486000 was the model used to generate GTA.
- best lost on mu_law: 2.935 (????)

TODO:
- Pruning
    - Check if there is any significant speedup with 100% sparsity
- Begin merging the three projects:
    - Fix saving wavs in the synthesizer preprocessor
    - Single inference demo (without GUI)
    - Single big inference tool (with GUI)
    - Single config file (or args???? -> could be both: default to config values)
    - Three hparams files (inside packages?)
    - Proper versions in requirements.txt (do something different for inference and training?)
- Clean up the rest of the code (' to "), Check all TODOs
- Move root of repo to SV2TTS (the rest isn't necessary)
- Put on github (RECHECK ALL REQUIREMENTS (+VLIBS))
- Make demo website
- Write something
- Cite all datasets
