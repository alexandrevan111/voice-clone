NOTES:
- On eddard, tacotron_model.ckpt-486000 was the model used to generate GTA.

TODO:
- Begin server-side training of linear then mel and delete the local outdated GTA
- Meanwhile, work on a rough inference demo (don't forget to show side-by-side generated and original sample)
- Clean up the rest of the code
