How about a nonlinear encoding? https://i.imgur.com/xRWn6AE.png
-> talk about linear encoding and mulaw


NOTES:
- tacotron_model.ckpt-486000 was the model used to generate GTA.
- best lost on mu_law: 2.935 (????)

TODO:
- Pruning
- Begin merging the three projects:
    - Single inference demo (without GUI)
    - Single big inference tool (with GUI)
    - Single config file (or args???? -> could be both: default to config values)
    - Three hparams files (inside packages?)
    - Proper versions in requirements.txt
- Clean up the rest of the code
- Move root of repo to SV2TTS
- Put on github (INCLUDE VLIBS)
- Make demo website
- Write something

Some noisy speakers: 40, 

- moved files
- removed old saved models for encoder
