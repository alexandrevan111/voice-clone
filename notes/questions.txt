- Am I going to need a different embedding for the voice of a same speaker in two different languages? I may need to formulate a "unique encoding hypothesis", i.e. that two people with the same voice in language A would also have the same voice in language B. This is likely not a true hypothesis but still a reasonable simplification for the voice transfer problem.
