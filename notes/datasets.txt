### TATOEBA ###
URL: https://tatoeba.org/

DESCRIPTION: Tatoeba is a collection of (generally short) sentences with corresponding translations. It is a collaborative project that relies on the free contribution of its users to grow. A sentence is given by a user in a given language, and anyone is then free to provide a new sentence as translation in another language that they are comfortable with. Users are also allowed to provide their own voice recording of a sentence, but this is not mandatory.

EXAMPLE: The sentence "I'm not blaming you", with audio translations in French, German and several other languages: https://tatoeba.org/eng/sentences/show/2548229

SIZE: ~460k sentences that contain an audio reading. Spoken sentences indexed by language are shown on the right column of this page: https://tatoeba.org/eng/stats/sentences_by_language. Sentences that are linked with a least one spoken English translation are listed here: http://www.manythings.org/sentences/audioplayer/. More widespread languages have generally more translations available (e.g. Dutch: 10k, French: 37k, German: 52k, Italian: 48k, Japanese: 26k, Portuguese: 29k, Russian: 74k, Spanish: 47k, Turkish: 166k).

ACQUISITION: Sentences that have spoken audio are indexed in a file available here: https://tatoeba.org/eng/downloads (under "Sentences with audio"). In order to obtain translations by a same users, one can browse https://tatoeba.org/eng/users/all and lookup the list of audio recordings for each user. No direct dataset download nor API is provided, so writing a crawler is necessary.

ENCODING: None enforced, however all files are in mp3. Most files have a bitrate of 48kbps.
