TRANSFER LEARNING FROM SPEAKER VERIFICATION TO MULTISPEAKER TEXT-TO-SPEECH SYNTHESIS:
- ASR to remove silence... Any different from WEBRTCVAD? They mention 14->5s median duration, which sounds like a big reduction to me (maybe it's just because it's the median). Will have to check the samples myself.
- VCTK and LibriSpeech were seperately used for different models.
- Same speaker set for training and validation in VCTK but disjoint for LibriSpeech.
- Noise reduction applied to the spectrogram. Go figure if I'll ever implement that.
- Note that VCTK is 1/10th the duration of LibriSpeech. Is it even worth bothering at this point? I could just start with LibriSpeech and add it later anyway.
- Guess I will have to skip on the phoneme inputs also. Maybe Waveglow implements them? Would also have to check if it ever appears in the Tacotron 2 paper at all.



-------------------------------------------------

- Interface train-clean
- Listen to inverted samples to check if the silence removal is ok
- Begin with train-clean to see if that works
- If it does, maybe consider adding VCTK then train-other
